		// % is a modulus, which calculates remainders. 
		// ++var means it adds one to the variable before it's used. Putting it after means it adds one after it's used.
		// When evaluating an expression with multiple values of declarations, Java automatically converts the operands to appropriate types.
		// You can explicitly convert a value from one type to another using the (type)value notation.
		// Casting a variable of a type with a small range to a variable of a type with a larger range is known as widening a type.
		// Widening a type can be performance automatically without explicit casting, narrowing a type has to be performance automatically.
